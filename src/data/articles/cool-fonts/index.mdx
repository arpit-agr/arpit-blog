Hereâ€™s a small collection of fonts that I find incredibly cool and would love to use in future projects.

## [Alfa Slab One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alfa+Slab+One)

I love the bold design of this font. Google has tagged it as a serif [fat face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_face). But it's a slab serif font. It's literally in the name.
