Recently, I was reading [Jan Miksovsky's article](https://jan.miksovsky.com/posts/2025/04-17-zero-dependencies) on how he built a basic static site generator using plain JS with zero dependencies.

While exploring the [source code](https://github.com/WebOrigami/pondlife-zero-deps), I noticed the following bit of code:

```js
// For sorting in natural order
const naturalOrder = new Intl.Collator(undefined, {
  numeric: true,
}).compare;
```

I was totally unaware of the [`Intl.Collator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator) API and that it can be used for sorting. This sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole.

I learned that my mental model of how JavaScript's default array [`sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) works is wrong. I also learned a counter-intuitive detail about its behavior with numbers. But, most importantly, I learned about better ways to handle sorting correctly in JavaScript, including the neat `Intl.Collator` API that Jan's code led me to discover.

Consider the following array of numbers:

```js
const array = [9, 8, 7, 60, 5];
array.sort();
```

Now, what do you think is the result?

As someone who is not a JavaScript expert, I thought the output would be the following:

```js
[5, 7, 8, 9, 60]; // Output
```

I was wrong. The correct output is the following:

```js
[5, 60, 7, 8, 9]; // Output
```

Now, it was important to understand why I was wrong.

## The default sorting behaviour

By default, when no compare function is provided, the `sort()` method converts each element into a string and then compares these strings character by character based on their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values. (JavaScript strings use the UTF-16 character encoding).

When we sort the array in my example using the default `sort()`, the numbers are first converted to strings. Then, the comparison starts with the UTF-16 code unit value of the first character of each string. The character '6' in '60' has a UTF-16 code unit value of 54, which is lower than the code unit values for '7' (55), '8' (56), and '9' (57). The rest of the string ('0' in '60') is only considered if the first characters are the same. This is why '60' appears before '7', '8', and '9' in the sorted output.

```js
"5".charCodeAt(0); // Output: 53
"60".charCodeAt(0); // Output: 54
"7".charCodeAt(0); // Output: 55
"8".charCodeAt(0); // Output: 56
"9".charCodeAt(0); // Output: 57
```

## Sorting Numbers Correctly

If you are specifically sorting an array that contains only numbers, the standard way to achieve correct numeric sorting is to provide a simple compare function:

```js
const numbersArray = [9, 8, 7, 60, 5];
numbersArray.sort((a, b) => a - b);

// Output: [5, 7, 8, 9, 60]
```

This compare function subtracts `b` from `a`. If the result is negative, `a` comes first. If positive, `b` comes first. If zero, their order doesn't change relative to each other. This correctly orders numbers based on their mathematical value.

## Natural Sorting with the Intl.Collator API

However, the simple `(a - b)` approach works reliably only for pure numbers. What about sorting strings that contain numbers, like filenames? This is where the `Intl.Collator` API with the `numeric: true` option shines. It provides the natural sorting behavior that correctly handles numbers alongside other characters.

```js
const naturalOrder = new Intl.Collator(undefined, {
  numeric: true,
}).compare;

// Note: Passing `undefined` as the locale uses the default locale of the browser's runtime.
// You could specify a locale string like 'en-US' here if needed.

const array = [9, 8, 7, 60, 5];
array.sort((a, b) => naturalOrder(a, b));
// Output: [5, 7, 8, 9, 60]
```

By passing the `compare` method of the `Intl.Collator` instance to `sort()`, we override the default string comparison. The `Intl.Collator` object, configured with `numeric: true`, knows how to compare '60' and '7' such that 60 is treated as a single number and correctly placed after 7, 8, and 9.

This API is incredibly useful for sorting strings that contain numbers in a human-expected way, such as lists of filenames like `IMG_1.png`, `IMG_2.png`, `IMG_10.png`, `IMG_20.png`.

```js
const files = ["IMG_2.png", "IMG_1.png", "IMG_10.png", "IMG_20.png"];
files.sort();
// Output: ['IMG_1.png', 'IMG_10.png', 'IMG_2.png', 'IMG_20.png']

files.sort((a, b) => naturalOrder(a, b));
// Output: ['IMG_1.png', 'IMG_2.png', 'IMG_10.png', 'IMG_20.png']
```

## How numeric: true works under the hood

When `numeric: true` is set, the collator detects numeric substrings inside the strings and parses those substrings as actual numbers, not as sequences of digits. And then it compares the numbers numerically, not character by character.

## Conclusion

For simple numeric arrays, `(a, b) => a - b` is your go-to. For more complex natural sorting needs with strings containing numbers, the `Intl.Collator` API provides a robust and locale-aware solution.
