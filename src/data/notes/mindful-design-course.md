I’m a web designer-developer who has mostly designed *and* built marketing websites for small to medium-sized businesses. I started designing because my clients didn’t have a designer and expected me to handle everything. But I’ve always felt like an imposter. It’s not a nice feeling. 

I’m really determined to change that, which is why I just bought [Scott Riley’s course, Mindful Design](https://piccalil.li/mindful-design). [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) is running a Black Friday sale on all their courses, including Mindful Design, and I can wholeheartedly recommend them.
