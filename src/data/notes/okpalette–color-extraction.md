Just spent some time playing with [OKpalette](https://okpalette.color.pizza/), a color extraction tool by [David Aerne](https://elastiq.ch/), and I'm in awe.

The 3D spinning text pulled me in immediately. I assumed it was done using JavaScript. It reminded me of the [Space Type Generator](https://spacetypegenerator.com/). Finding out it’s done using CSS genuinely blew my mind.

I loved the animations and the subtle use of audio while interacting with the UI. Then I watched [David’s walkthrough / demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkZlgJLGKI4) and realized the functionality is just as beautiful as the visuals, if not more.
