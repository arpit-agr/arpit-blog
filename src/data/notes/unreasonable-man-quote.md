> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

I learned about this quote by George Bernard Shaw from [Veritasium's video on The World's Most Important Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiUHjLxm3V0)

It instantly reminded me of the [<i lang="hi-Latn">Kaun Hai Tu</i> scene from Gully Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2z5dTOHsL0), where Murad embodies Shaw’s “unreasonable man.” In this scene, Murad is confronted by his father after quitting his job to pursue his dream. The father tries to convince Murad that his dreams need to match his reality. Murad then answers that he will change his reality to match his dreams.
