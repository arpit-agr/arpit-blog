[Jeremy Keith on mindset](https://adactio.com/journal/9688):

> If I really want to change someone’s mind, then I need to make the effort to first understand their mind. That’s going to be far more productive than declaring that my own mind is made up. After all, if *I* show no willingness to consider alternative viewpoints, why should they?
>
> There’s an old saying that before criticising someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. I’m going to try to put that into practice, and not for the two obvious reasons:
>
> 1. If we still disagree, now we’re a mile away from each other, and
> 1. I’ve got their shoes.
