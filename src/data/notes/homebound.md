I just watched [Homebound](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1227739), Neeraj Ghaywan’s second feature film. And it left me devastated.

The film is based on  [Basharat Peer's article ‘Taking Amrit Home’](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/opinion/sunday/India-migration-coronavirus.html) (which has since been retitled 'A Friendship, a Pandemic and a Death Beside the Highway’).

I highly recommend this film. But if you can’t watch it for whatever reason at least read the article.
