Earlier this month, I noted down [Jason's advice on how to get hired as a developer](https://arpit.blog/links/2025/12/developer-job-jason-lengstorf/). I’d also like to add the following point from [@brandon](https://x.com/burcs/status/2002013464387105231):

> **use the product**
>
> this is one of the first questions i ask in the interview anyways, ship and share something you've built on top of cloudflare. this alone will set you apart from most of the candidates, and it will show you are genuinely interested.

This complements Jason’s advice well, because it turns “show your work” into something concrete and product-specific.
