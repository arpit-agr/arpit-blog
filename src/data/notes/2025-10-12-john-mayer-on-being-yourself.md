[John Mayer on how trying and not doing it well enough is a wonderful technique for being yourself](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_GQbDRGm__o&t=2768):

> Failing to sound exactly like the person you want to sound like is a wonderful way to sound like yourself. So I’m not necessarily thinking this thing from scratch, going, <i>Okay, I’m gonna, like, do Jerry-esque things, but I’m still gonna sound like me.</i> No, it’s more like, <i>I want to sound just like Jerry,</i> and then the way I naturally, obviously don’t — that’s your personality. Music doesn't let you lie. […] You try to sound like who you want to sound like, and you just will always end up sounding like you.

I like this advice. It is an interesting take on the learning by copying method.
