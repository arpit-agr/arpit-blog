> `@ts-expect-error` will let you know when there's no TypeScript error to silence and when it has become useless. `@ts-ignore` will stay put and sit silently wherever you placed it.

Not only did I not know the difference between `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-expect-error`, I was totally unaware there was such a directive as `@ts-expect-error`.
