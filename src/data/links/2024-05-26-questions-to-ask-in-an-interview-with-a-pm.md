In this piece, Karan Thapar emphasizes that:

- Interviewers must remember they are asking questions on behalf of the public.
- Questions must be relevant, significant, and timely to demand accountability.
- The interviewer must persistently push for answers instead of allowing monologues or tangents.
- The interview should not serve as a platform to attack critics, but rather an occasion to make the PM respond to valid criticisms.
- The interviewer and PM must interact as equals, with the former feeling empowered to challenge evasions or dubious claims.
