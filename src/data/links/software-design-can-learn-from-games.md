Great talk by Andy Allen on how software designers can learn from game designers. 

It reminded me of [the Wheel by Adam Argyle](https://chrome.dev/carousel/vertical/wheel/), inspired by the arcade game Black Emperor. The game feel is so strong that I find myself scrolling up and down again and again just to play with it and experience that delightful bounce effect.
