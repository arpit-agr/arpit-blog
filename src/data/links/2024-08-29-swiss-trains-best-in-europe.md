I love this bit from the video where Jason quotes Enrique Peñalosa, the former mayor of Bogotá, Colombia:

> A developed country is not where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.

But why is it important that wealthy people take public transportation? Because, as Jason mentions,

> […] for better or for worse, these people are likely to have the power and political influence to demand efficient service.
