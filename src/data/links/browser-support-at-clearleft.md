> Underlying our browser support policy are two foundational principles:
> 
> 1. Website content and core functionality should be accessible to everyone.
> 2. It’s okay for websites to look different in different browsers.
>
> If content is unreadable in some browsers, that’s a bug that we will fix.
> 
> If content is displayed slightly differently in some browsers, we consider that to be a facet of the web, not a bug. This means that there will sometimes be subtle visual and functional differences from browser to browser. We deem this acceptable provided content and core functionality are unaffected.
