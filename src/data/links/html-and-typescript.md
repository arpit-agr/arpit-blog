Mandy Michael uses a brilliant analogy to explain why developers must get to know the HTML elements available to them and use the appropriate one for their content.

> In TypeScript, we have the concept of an `any` type. When you assign a type of `any` it means the content can be anything. […] But if everything is typed as `any` then you lose the benefits of the language.
>
> This is the same with HTML. If you use the `<div>` everywhere, you aren’t making the most of language. Because of this it’s important that you actively choose what the right element is and don’t just use the default `<div>`.

This reminded me of the following quote by [Jen Simmons from their HTML course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training-4/the-syntax-of-html-elements):

> HTML syntax itself is fairly simple. The trickier part is knowing which tags to use when.
