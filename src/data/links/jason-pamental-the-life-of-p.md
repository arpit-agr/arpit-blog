I just saw Jason Pamental's excellent talk on 'The Life of `<p>`'. As mentioned in the YouTube description, in this talk Jason explores:

> the varying ways the lowly `<p>` has been designed in print—from the earliest printed works on through to today […]

There’s one moment during the Q&A where Jason mentions:

> […] you see the page gets small, but they don’t change the scale of the headers. So you end up with like an `<h1>` with one word per line. It’s a really awkward break. So I think proportion with varying screen size is probably the most overlooked thing right now that I’d want to see people think about more.

I wasn’t a web developer 10 years ago when Jason gave this talk, but with over five years of experience now, it’s striking that I only became aware of proportional type scaling as an idea in the last couple of years. Nowadays, I use [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) to create fluid type (and space) scales across viewport ranges, which helps address the problem Jason mentioned.
