Zach Leatherman on frontend architecture and building for longevity amid framework churn:

> 1. 👏 Hire someone that’s good at HTML and CSS to build components independent of JS frameworks 👏
> 2. Plug components into a JS framework and layer on behavior later
> 3. Pay HTML/CSS devs what they deserve for giving part of your codebase longer shelf life than unpasteurized milk
