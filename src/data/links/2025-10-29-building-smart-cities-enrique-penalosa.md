Enrique Peñalosa on how to build cities that prioritise human beings over cars and guarantee a citizen's right to safe mobility.

In my opinion, the following bit at the start of the video certainly holds true for India:

> The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see, for example, that in terms of transport, an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport or bicycles.
